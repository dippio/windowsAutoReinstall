# windowsAutoReinstall
##Automatically redownloads some packages and updates windows


i prefer linux over windows, i just gotta reinstall it for school sometimes

using a package manager is just more comfortable and quicker for me

## what it does
installs a bunch of programs and tools via chocolatey (also installs the package manager in question)

## how to use
run 'install.ps1' as admin

accept any admin requests that pop up
