# windowsAutoReinstall
Automatically redownloads some packages and updates windows


i prefer linux over windows, i just gotta reinstall it for school sometimes

using a package manager is just more comfortable and quicker for me

## what it does
installs sudo via scoop and a bunch of other programs via chocolatey (and also installs the package managers in question)

## how to use
run 'install.ps1' (not as superuser though)

accept any admin requests that pop up
